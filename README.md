# Predicting-Yearly-Compensation-using-Logistic-Regression
The aim of this project is to predict the yearly compensation of people who participated in a survey. The features of the model were extracted from the survey questions. I applied logistic regression to the data and tuned its hyperparameters using 10-fold cross validation. \n
The highest acheived f1-score is: 0.539125208018121 \n
Parameters corresponding to the optimal f1-score are:\n
  c (the parameter that is inversely proportional to the strength of the regularization used in the loss function): 0.01 \n
  solver(the type of algorithm used in computations of the optimal cost function): newton-cg\n
