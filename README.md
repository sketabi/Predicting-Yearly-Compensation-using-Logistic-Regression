# Predicting-Yearly-Compensation-using-Logistic-Regression
The aim of this project is to predict the yearly compensation of people who participated in a survey. The features of the model were extracted from the survey questions. I applied logistic regression to the data and tuned its hyperparameters using 10-fold cross validation. 
The highest acheived f1-score:0.539125208018121 
Parameters corresponding to the optimal f1-score: 
  c (the parameter that is inversely proportional to the strength of the regularization): 0.01 
  solver(the type of algorithm used in computations of the optimal cost function): newton-cg
